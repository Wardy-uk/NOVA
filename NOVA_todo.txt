N.O.V.A — TO DO
================

--- triage ---

(empty)


=== CURRENT STATUS (28 Feb 2026) ===

Deployed at https://nova.nurtur.tech | v1.0.4 | Branch: nova-codex
IIS reverse proxy → Node.js (NSSM) on Windows Server VM

6 areas: My NOVA, Service Desk, Onboarding, Delivery, CRM, Admin
5 MCP integrations: Jira, MS365, Monday.com, D365, OneDrive
0 bugs | 0 blockers | Monday.com syncing 22 tasks across 5 boards

Known limitation:
  - MS365 transient sources may not populate on restart until manual sync or 10s retry

Deploy: .\deploy\deploy.ps1 -Branch nova-codex (on server C:\Nurtur\NOVA)
Completed items: see NOVA_completed.txt


=== DO NEXT: Tuning (BA session with user) ===

1. Jira SLA prioritisation — tickets over SLA or overdue an update should be
   prioritised. SLA timer and attention endpoint already exist. Needs user to
   define the rules (which fields, thresholds, priority weights).

2. Configure auto-deploy on server — register deploy/auto-deploy.ps1 as a
   Windows Scheduled Task. Script exists, just needs Task Scheduler setup.


=== TIER 1: Daily workflow enhancements ===

3.  Chat to NOVA — conversational AI to ask questions about your tasks
    ("what's overdue?", "summarise my Jira tickets", "what should I focus on?")
4.  Correlate Jira tickets with onboarding tasks — link SD tickets to
    deliveries, show related tickets on delivery detail, auto-tag by customer
5.  CRM partners list in onboarding — validate customer for ticket creation
6.  Service Desk Dashboard — distinct customers, tickets over SLA, overdue updates


=== TIER 2: Onboarding & automation ===

7.  Jira settings for ticket creation — configure request type field IDs
    in Admin > Integrations


=== TIER 3: Platform maturity ===

8.  Architecture review for 50+ users — sql.js limitations, MCP pooling,
    migration path (sql.js → better-sqlite3 or PostgreSQL)
9.  Customer 360 timeline — unified per-customer view across all sources
10. Notifications & alerts — SLA breaches, delivery dates, onboarding stalls
11. Team workload view — onboarder/assignee load heatmap
12. Activity audit log — who changed what and when
13. Jira OAuth — replace email+token with "Sign in with Atlassian"
14. Documentation — keep help page updated as features change [ONGOING]


=== TIER 4: Nice to have ===

15. Email attachments — list/get/add attachments on messages
16. Multi-calendar support — list-calendars route exists, needs UI
17. Workflows for tickets and deliveries
18. Jira move-team automation (move ticket to a different project)
19. Browse mail folders — route exists, needs UI
20. Browse specific planner plans


=== FUTURE CONSIDERATION ===

- Global search across all entities
- Scheduled email digests (weekly delivery progress, overdue items)
- CSV/PDF export for stakeholders
- Keyboard shortcuts (G+D, G+T, /, N)
- PWA support (manifest + service worker)
- Saved filters/views
- Webhook receiver (real-time Jira/Monday sync)
- Sales pipeline (order form → task → welcome pack)
