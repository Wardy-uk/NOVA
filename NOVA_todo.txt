TO DO
-----

=== CURRENT STATUS (26 Feb 2026) ===

N.O.V.A is a fully functional personal productivity aggregator running locally on Windows.
It pulls tasks from Jira, Microsoft 365 (Planner, To-Do, Calendar, Email), Monday.com, and
Dynamics 365 CRM into a single dashboard with AI-powered standups, focus prioritisation, and
delivery tracking.

What's working:
  - Express + React/Vite + SQLite stack, JWT auth with Entra SSO option
  - 5 MCP integrations: Jira (45 tools), MS365 (70 tools), Monday.com (46 tools), D365, OneDrive
  - 6 main areas: My NOVA (dashboard/AI/standup), Service Desk (kanban/calendar), Onboarding
    (matrix config + Jira ticket automation), Delivery (xlsx/SP sync, milestones), CRM (D365),
    Admin (users, teams, roles, permissions, integrations, milestones, onboarding, feedback)
  - Delivery milestones (30-day model) with auto-creation, checklist tracking, task surfacing
  - Onboarding ticket orchestrator — idempotent, resume-safe, dry-run capable
  - Multi-user with role-based access, per-user settings/AI keys, file-based stores
  - Email send/reply/forward, calendar create/edit, SharePoint sync push/pull

What's not working or partially working:
  - Service Desk "Unassigned" and "All" filters (BUG1 — JQL only fetches current user's tickets)
  - Monday.com syncs 0 tasks (connection fixed, but needs board IDs configured or search tuned)
  - MS365 To-Do sync errors (MCP returning non-JSON for some lists)
  - Not deployed — runs on localhost only

Current branch: nova-codex (many uncommitted changes across 40+ files)

To Triage - Feedback should record who sent the feedback, and allow admin to reply, also, add the option to add the feedback to our todo list doc

=== BLOCKERS / BUGS ===

BUG1. Service Desk — Unassigned and All Tickets filters don't work
      - filterByOwnership() logic looks correct, need to debug why 'unassigned'/'all' return wrong results

BUG2. [FIXED] Monday.com MCP — globally-installed v1.16.1 + OTEL_SDK_DISABLED, adapter updated for new tool names
      - Needs board IDs in Settings > Monday.com for full sync

clear out D365 records for a fresh repull - remove accounts that aren't assigned to me

CRM - total MRR value is bigger than size of panel


=== DO NEXT (high priority, unblocks daily use) ===

- Deploy to server — move off local dev, make NOVA accessible remotely
    - containerise (Docker) or deploy to internal server
    - replace in-memory SQLite with file-persisted or PostgreSQL
    - environment config (JWT secret, DB path, MCP server paths)

- O365 SSO — allow Microsoft login alongside username/password

- Map roles to tab & feature access — custom roles (Admin > Permissions) wired to route guards + UI visibility

- Jira SLA prioritisation — tickets over SLA or overdue an update should be prioritised (user will supply logic)


=== QUICK WINS (small effort, visible impact) ===

- [DONE] Rename Command Centre to 'My NOVA'
- [DONE] Rename Onboarding > Config to 'Onboarding Matrix'
- [DONE] Add Sale Type filter on onboarding matrix
- [DONE] Service Desk Kanban — default groupBy to 'date' buckets


=== TIER 1: Daily workflow enhancements ===

1. Dashboard KPIs — include Onboarding metrics (delivery milestones progress, overdue milestones, onboarding runs)
2. My Focus auto-population — tickets over SLA or overdue update auto-appear in My Focus
3. Delivery kanban board — drag cards between status columns (Not Started → In Progress → Training → Complete)
4. Add CRM integration partners list to onboarding — validate for ticket creation


=== TIER 2: Onboarding ticket automation ===

5. Ticket creation UI — form in Admin > Onboarding to trigger POST /api/onboarding/create-tickets
   - sale type dropdown, customer name, onboarding ref, due date
   - dry-run preview before live execution
   - show result (parent key + child keys) or error
6. Jira settings for ticket creation — configure request type field IDs in Admin > Integrations (Jira Onboarding card)
7. Test ticket creation — dry run + live test against Jira NT project
8. Onboarding run history UI — view past runs (status, parent/child keys, errors)


=== TIER 2: Service Desk ===

9.  Service Desk Dashboard — distinct customers, tickets over SLA, overdue updates


=== TIER 3: Platform maturity ===

10. Customer 360 timeline — unified per-customer view across deliveries, CRM, Jira, onboarding, emails
11. Notifications & alerts — SLA breaches, delivery dates, onboarding stalls, overdue tasks (in-app + email digest)
12. Team workload view — onboarder/assignee load heatmap across deliveries + Jira
13. Activity audit log — who changed what and when (append-only table, Admin timeline view)
14. Jira OAuth device-code flow — replace email+token with "Sign in with Atlassian" button
    - register Atlassian OAuth 2.0 app (3LO)
    - implement device code / authorization code flow
    - per-user token storage + refresh
    - may require replacing mcp-atlassian with direct Jira REST calls
15. [ONGOING] Documentation — keep help page updated as features change


=== TIER 4: Nice to have ===

16. Email attachments — list/get/add attachments on messages
17. Multi-calendar support — list-calendars route exists, needs UI
18. Workflows for tickets and deliveries
19. Jira move-team automation (move ticket to a different Jira project)
20. Browse mail folders — route exists (GET /api/o365/mail/folders), needs UI
21. Browse specific planner plans — get-planner-plan, list-plan-tasks


=== FUTURE CONSIDERATION ===

- Global search — search across all entities from a single search bar
- Scheduled email digests — weekly delivery progress, overdue items via M365 send-mail
- CSV/PDF export — export filtered data for stakeholders
- Keyboard shortcuts — G+D deliveries, G+T tasks, / search, N new entry
- PWA support — manifest + service worker for installable app
- Saved filters/views — bookmark favourite filter combos
- Webhook receiver — inbound Jira/Monday webhooks for real-time sync
- Sales pipeline — replace onboarding spreadsheet (order form → task → welcome pack)
- Deprecate PA workaround (on hold pending O365 integration stability)
