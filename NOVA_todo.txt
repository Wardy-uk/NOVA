N.O.V.A — TO DO
================

=== CURRENT STATUS (28 Feb 2026) ===

Deployed at https://nova.nurtur.tech | v1.1.0 | Branch: nova-codex
IIS reverse proxy → Node.js (NSSM) on Windows Server VM

6 areas: My NOVA, Service Desk, Onboarding, Delivery, CRM, Admin
5 MCP integrations: Jira, MS365, Monday.com, D365, OneDrive
Milestone workflow engine: progressive task/ticket creation on lead-day triggers
AI chat, notifications, audit log, team workload, SD dashboard, Jira OAuth
0 bugs | 0 blockers | Monday.com syncing 22 tasks across 5 boards

Known limitation:
  - MS365 transient sources may not populate on restart until manual sync or 10s retry

Deploy: .\deploy\deploy.ps1 -Branch nova-codex (on server C:\Nurtur\NOVA)
Completed items: see NOVA_completed.txt


=== DO NEXT: Tuning (BA session with user) ===

8.  Jira SLA prioritisation — tickets over SLA or overdue an update should be
    prioritised. SLA timer and attention endpoint already exist. Needs user to
    define the rules (which fields, thresholds, priority weights).


=== TIER 2: Feature additions ===

25. Managers overview — management summary tab on each main area (activity,
    status, team performance). Partially addressed by Team Load + SD Dashboard
    but needs broader coverage across Onboarding and Delivery areas.
26. Delivery completion tracker — "Delivered Today / This Week / This Month"
    summary cards or section on the delivery page.


=== TIER 3: Platform maturity ===

13. Architecture review for 50+ users — sql.js limitations, MCP pooling,
    migration path (sql.js → better-sqlite3 or PostgreSQL)
14. Customer 360 timeline — unified per-customer view across all sources
19. Email attachments — list/get/add attachments on messages
20. Multi-calendar support — list-calendars route exists, needs UI
21. Workflows for tickets and deliveries
22. Jira move-team automation (move ticket to a different project)
23. Browse mail folders — route exists, needs UI
24. Browse specific planner plans


=== FUTURE CONSIDERATION ===

- Global search across all entities
- Scheduled email digests (weekly delivery progress, overdue items)
- CSV/PDF export for stakeholders
- Keyboard shortcuts (G+D, G+T, /, N)
- PWA support (manifest + service worker)
- Saved filters/views
- Webhook receiver (real-time Jira/Monday sync)
- Sales pipeline (order form → task → welcome pack)
