TO DO
-----

--- triage ---

(empty — all triaged)


=== PLAN: 28 Feb 2026 ===

1. Cleanup debug artifacts (~5 min)
   - Remove `/api/debug/attention-fields` endpoint from index.ts
   - Remove `_debug` field from GET /api/tasks response in tasks.ts
   - Remove debug button + copyDebug handler from DailyStatsView.tsx
   - Commit, push, deploy

2. Fix BUG6: Kanban drag-and-drop transition (~30 min)
   - Auto-select the transition matching the target column
   - Ensure transition actually syncs back to Jira
   - Core workflow bug — kanban is broken without this

3. Fix BUG5: MS365 transient sources empty after restart (~30 min)
   - Auto-sync fires before MCP is connected — Planner/Email/Calendar return 0
   - Options: delay sync until MCP ready, or retry sync after short delay if 0 results
   - Affects every deploy/restart for all users

4. Stretch goals (if time permits)
   - Correlate Jira tickets with onboarding tasks
   - Chat to NOVA conversational AI (scope/design only)


=== CURRENT STATUS (27 Feb 2026) ===

N.O.V.A is deployed to a Windows Server VM at https://nova.nurtur.tech, served via
IIS reverse proxy to a Node.js backend managed by NSSM as a Windows Service.

What's working:
  - Express + React/Vite + SQLite stack, JWT auth with Entra SSO option
  - 5 MCP integrations: Jira (45 tools), MS365 (70 tools), Monday.com (46 tools), D365, OneDrive
  - 6 main areas: My NOVA (dashboard/AI/standup), Service Desk (kanban/calendar), Onboarding
    (matrix config + Jira ticket automation), Delivery (xlsx/SP sync, milestones), CRM (D365),
    Admin (users, teams, roles, permissions, integrations, milestones, onboarding, feedback)
  - Per-user task scoping — users only see tasks from integrations they've personally enabled;
    admin users fall back to global settings. Applied to: tasks, stats, service desk, Ask NOVA,
    standup (including cached ritual enrichment). Shared source-filter utility.
  - Service Desk: live Jira search for My/Unassigned/All filters, kanban drag-and-drop transitions,
    Current Tier (customfield_12981) and Assignee shown on all ticket displays
  - Delivery milestones (30-day model) with auto-creation, checklist tracking, task surfacing
  - Onboarding ticket orchestrator — idempotent, resume-safe, dry-run capable
  - Multi-user with role-based access, per-user settings/AI keys (self-serve in My Settings)
  - Email send/reply/forward, calendar create/edit, SharePoint sync push/pull
  - Session-only MS365 data — transient tasks purged on server restart, auto-sync on first load
  - Silent background refresh — all screens poll in background without UI disruption
  - Security: helmet headers, login rate limiting, debug endpoints admin-gated
  - Interactive tour overlay for new users
  - Feedback system with admin reply and create-task-from-feedback
  - Deployed: IIS + NSSM on Windows Server, git-based deploys via deploy.ps1

What's not fully working:
  - Monday.com syncs 0 tasks — connection ok but needs board IDs or search tuning
  - MS365 To-Do sync errors — MCP returning non-JSON for some lists
  - MS365 Planner/Email/Calendar may not populate after server restart — auto-sync fires but
    MCP connection may not be ready; works after manual sync from Settings

Current branch: nova-codex
Deploy: .\deploy\deploy.ps1 -Branch nova-codex (on server C:\Nurtur\NOVA)


=== BLOCKERS (waiting on external action) ===

BLOCK1. Monday.com syncs 0 tasks
        Connection works (46 tools), but no tasks pulled. Needs board IDs configured in
        Settings > Monday.com, or the adapter's search query tuned.


=== BUGS ===

BUG2. MS365 To-Do sync errors — MCP returning non-JSON for some lists
      [todoAdapter] Error fetching list Tasks/Flagged Emails: SyntaxError "MCP error" is not valid JSON

BUG5. MS365 Planner/Email/Calendar show 0 tasks after server restart
      Auto-sync fires on first page load but transient sources don't populate.
      Likely MCP not connected yet when sync runs. Manual sync from Settings works.

BUG6. Kanban drag-and-drop transition doesn't auto-select or sync to Jira
      Dragging a ticket to a new status column (e.g. "Waiting for Assignee") shows the
      transition modal but doesn't pre-select the matching transition. The transition
      also doesn't save/sync back to Jira — ticket stays in old status.


=== DO NEXT (high priority) ===

1. Jira SLA prioritisation — tickets over SLA or overdue an update should be prioritised
   (user will supply logic). SLA timer and attention endpoint already exist.


=== CLEANUP ===

(none pending)

=== QUICK WINS (small effort, visible impact) ===

- Dashboard KPIs — add Onboarding metrics (milestone progress, overdue milestones, onboarding runs)
- My Focus auto-population — tickets over SLA or overdue update auto-appear
- Delivery kanban board — drag cards between status columns
- Auto-deploy watcher — PowerShell polling script (git fetch + compare, run deploy.ps1), Task Scheduler every 2-5 mins


=== TIER 1: Daily workflow enhancements ===

2. Chat to NOVA — conversational AI to ask questions about your tasks (e.g. "what's overdue?",
   "summarise my Jira tickets", "what should I focus on?")
3. Correlate Jira tickets with onboarding tasks — link SD tickets to deliveries, show related
   tickets on delivery detail, auto-tag by customer
4. Add CRM integration partners list to onboarding — validate for ticket creation
5. Service Desk Dashboard — distinct customers, tickets over SLA, overdue updates


=== TIER 2: Onboarding ticket automation ===

6. Ticket creation UI — form in Admin > Onboarding to trigger POST /api/onboarding/create-tickets
   - sale type dropdown, customer name, onboarding ref, due date
   - dry-run preview before live execution
   - show result (parent key + child keys) or error
7. Jira settings for ticket creation — configure request type field IDs in Admin > Integrations
8. Onboarding run history UI — view past runs (status, parent/child keys, errors)


=== TIER 3: Platform maturity ===

9.  Review architecture/infrastructure for supporting 50+ users
    - sql.js in-memory limitations, MCP connection pooling, concurrent requests
    - Session management at scale, database migration path (sql.js → better-sqlite3 or PostgreSQL)
10. Customer 360 timeline — unified per-customer view across deliveries, CRM, Jira, onboarding, emails
11. Notifications & alerts — SLA breaches, delivery dates, onboarding stalls (in-app + email digest)
12. Team workload view — onboarder/assignee load heatmap across deliveries + Jira
13. Activity audit log — who changed what and when (append-only table, Admin timeline view)
14. Jira OAuth device-code flow — replace email+token with "Sign in with Atlassian"
15. [ONGOING] Documentation — keep help page updated as features change


=== TIER 4: Nice to have ===

16. Email attachments — list/get/add attachments on messages
17. Multi-calendar support — list-calendars route exists, needs UI
18. Workflows for tickets and deliveries
19. Jira move-team automation (move ticket to a different Jira project)
20. Browse mail folders — route exists (GET /api/o365/mail/folders), needs UI
21. Browse specific planner plans — get-planner-plan, list-plan-tasks


=== FUTURE CONSIDERATION ===

- Global search — search across all entities from a single search bar
- Scheduled email digests — weekly delivery progress, overdue items via M365 send-mail
- CSV/PDF export — export filtered data for stakeholders
- Keyboard shortcuts — G+D deliveries, G+T tasks, / search, N new entry
- PWA support — manifest + service worker for installable app
- Saved filters/views — bookmark favourite filter combos
- Webhook receiver — inbound Jira/Monday webhooks for real-time sync
- Sales pipeline — replace onboarding spreadsheet (order form → task → welcome pack)
- Deprecate PA workaround (on hold pending O365 integration stability)
