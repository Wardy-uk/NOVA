Known limitation:
  - MS365 transient sources may not populate on restart until manual sync or 10s retry

Completed items: see NOVA_completed.txt


=== DONE (1 Mar 2026) ===

(moved to NOVA_completed.txt)


=== DO NEXT ===

T4. Onboarding ticket status — on each onboarding/delivery item, show what
    Jira tickets have been created and their live status (batch-fetch from
    delivery_milestones.jira_keys and onboarding_runs.child_keys)


=== TECHINCAL DEBT ===

TD1.  Lock down global settings exposure — restrict `GET /api/settings` to admin
    or return a redacted subset; never expose `jwt_secret` or integration creds.
TD2.  Role-guard integrations endpoints — only admin can modify admin-only
    integrations (SSO, Jira onboarding, Service Desk config); validate updates.
TD3.  Fix production SPA fallback route — replace invalid `{*path}` with Express
    wildcard to ensure SPA loads in prod.
TD4.  Jira OAuth base URL resolution — correct redirect base when `FRONTEND_URL`
    is set to avoid localhost callbacks in prod.
TD5.  Remove sensitive debug logging — Jira attention debug logs and Monday board
    debug file should be behind an explicit debug flag.
TD6.  Settings/users file-store durability — add locking or move to DB-backed
    persistence to prevent concurrent write loss.
TD7.  Architecture review (50+ users) — see `docs/architecture-review.md`.


=== TIER 2: Feature additions ===

(empty)


=== TIER 3: Platform maturity ===

13. Architecture review for 50+ users — sql.js limitations, MCP pooling,
    migration path (sql.js → better-sqlite3 or PostgreSQL)
14. Customer 360 timeline — unified per-customer view across all sources
19. Email attachments — list/get/add attachments on messages
20. Multi-calendar support — list-calendars route exists, needs UI
21. Workflows for tickets and deliveries
22. Jira move-team automation (move ticket to a different project)
23. Browse mail folders — route exists, needs UI
24. Browse specific planner plans


=== FUTURE CONSIDERATION ===

- Global search across all entities
- Scheduled email digests (weekly delivery progress, overdue items)
- CSV/PDF export for stakeholders
- Keyboard shortcuts (G+D, G+T, /, N)
- PWA support (manifest + service worker)
- Saved filters/views
- Webhook receiver (real-time Jira/Monday sync)
- Sales pipeline (order form → task → welcome pack)
