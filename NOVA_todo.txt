5 MCP integrations: Jira, MS365, Monday.com, D365, OneDrive
Milestone workflow engine: progressive task/ticket creation on lead-day triggers
AI chat, notifications, audit log, team workload, SD dashboard, Jira OAuth
0 bugs | 0 blockers | Monday.com syncing 22 tasks across 5 boards

Known limitation:
  - MS365 transient sources may not populate on restart until manual sync or 10s retry

Completed items: see NOVA_completed.txt


=== DONE (28 Feb 2026) ===

[x] 28. BUG FIX: MS365 not showing entries — global settings not seeded for
    no-field integrations (msgraph). Fixed global seeding logic in
    integrations.ts so MCP restarts correctly after reboot.
[x] 29. Renamed "Ask N.O.V.A" → "NOVA Insights" — tab label, help page,
    tour overlay, debug panel all updated. Confirmed no remaining references.
[x] My NOVA tabs renamed: My Dashboard, My Tasks, My Team, My Chat
[x] Standup → NOVA Briefing — tab renamed, heading updated, AI greeting
    now time-appropriate (morning/afternoon/evening based on hour).
[x] Service Desk — all tabs centered (max-w constraints on Dashboard,
    Kanban, Calendar, Tickets, Breached views).
[x] NOVA Insights button — renamed "Ask N.O.V.A" button in NextActions.
[x] NOVA Insights — added "All Tasks" button to source filter.
[x] Planner/Email/Calendar not showing — code fix deployed (item 28), ops
    task only (redeploy + user re-enable msgraph).
[x] 27. Jira 410 fix — DEFAULT_CONFIG changed from 'Service Request' to
    'Support', request type field emptied, settings.json defaulted from
    real ticket JSON. Falls back to personal Jira creds when no service
    account configured.


=== DO NEXT ===

32. BUG: SD Kanban drag doesn't update view or tickets — drag-and-drop may
    fail silently or not refresh the local state after Jira transition.

8.  Jira SLA prioritisation — tickets over SLA or overdue an update should be
    prioritised. SLA timer and attention endpoint already exist. Needs user to
    define the rules (which fields, thresholds, priority weights).

30. Link D365 account number to delivery entries — associate a Dynamics 365
    account record with an onboarding delivery item for cross-referencing.
    Schema migration + interface added. UI autocomplete linkage still needed.

31. Milestone ticket creation button — on delivery milestone tasks where the
    action is to create a Jira ticket, add an inline button to raise the
    ticket directly from the milestone row.


=== TIER 2: Feature additions ===

25. Managers overview — management summary tab on each main area (activity,
    status, team performance). Partially addressed by Team Load + SD Dashboard
    but needs broader coverage across Onboarding and Delivery areas.
26. Delivery completion tracker — "Delivered Today / This Week / This Month"
    summary cards or section on the delivery page.
33. Add manual refresh button to appropriate tabs (My Focus, Tasks, SD tabs,
    Delivery, CRM). Silent background refresh already exists — just expose
    a manual trigger.


=== TIER 3: Platform maturity ===

13. Architecture review for 50+ users — sql.js limitations, MCP pooling,
    migration path (sql.js → better-sqlite3 or PostgreSQL)
14. Customer 360 timeline — unified per-customer view across all sources
19. Email attachments — list/get/add attachments on messages
20. Multi-calendar support — list-calendars route exists, needs UI
21. Workflows for tickets and deliveries
22. Jira move-team automation (move ticket to a different project)
23. Browse mail folders — route exists, needs UI
24. Browse specific planner plans


=== FUTURE CONSIDERATION ===

- Global search across all entities
- Scheduled email digests (weekly delivery progress, overdue items)
- CSV/PDF export for stakeholders
- Keyboard shortcuts (G+D, G+T, /, N)
- PWA support (manifest + service worker)
- Saved filters/views
- Webhook receiver (real-time Jira/Monday sync)
- Sales pipeline (order form → task → welcome pack)
